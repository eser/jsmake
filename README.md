## What is the jsmake?

jsmake is a task tool which runs user-defined tasks declared in `makefile.js`.

In other words, if you execute some commands or code to accomplish some tasks on your codebase, jsmake is the right tool to do it.

With the help of jsmake, project folder oriented tasks such as building sources, refactoring configuration files, deploying project on cloud can be done easily.

As a task tool it offers,

- Tasks with prerequisites,
- Tasks own descriptions and parameters,
- Async task execution with Promises,
- Developer-friendly API to be used as a library,
- Powerful command line argument parsing,
- Utility methods for various tasks such as glob, recursively delete directories or bump version in package.json,
- Environment variables handling (even in Windows),
- Event subscription for tasks and execution queues,


### jsmake vs Build Tools

jsmake is not a substitution for "build tools" like gulp.js. Apart from them, jsmake only concentrates on executing shell commands or user directives coded in JavaScript. So there are no pipelines, streams or plugins to be added as a dependency in `package.json`.

Instead, jsmake is a complementary product for build tools. For example, it can [interoperate with tools like gulp.js](samples/using-with-gulp-makefile.js).


## Quick Start

Execute `npm install jsmake -g` to install jsmake on your system.

After installing jsmake, `makefile.js` needs to be created at the root of your codebase. 


### Sample makefile.js

A sample `makefile.js` look like:

```js
jsmake.desc('Says hi to someone.');
jsmake.task('hello', function (argv) {
    console.log('hi ' + argv.name);
});
```

Other samples can be found in [samples/](samples/) folder, such as:

- [Alternative syntax](samples/alternative-syntax-makefile.js)
- [API](samples/api.js)
- [Async/Promises](samples/async-promises-makefile.js)
- [Events](samples/events-makefile.js)
- [NPM Utils](samples/npm-utils-makefile.js)
- [Pre/Post Tasks](samples/pre-post-tasks-makefile.js)
- [Sequential Tasks](samples/sequential-tasks-makefile.js)
- [Shell Commands](samples/shell-commands-makefile.js)
- [Tasks with Descriptions](samples/tasks-with-descriptions-makefile.js)
- [Tasks with Parameters](samples/tasks-with-parameters-makefile.js)
- [Using with gulp.js](samples/using-with-gulp-makefile.js)


### Getting Help and List of Tasks

Running `jsmake` command will execute the task named `default`. If there is no task defined as `default`, jsmake will display the help message.

Help content consists of usage of jsmake, the list of declared tasks and their parameters and descriptions. These information also can be displayed with `jsmake -h` command.

Help output of [jsmake's own makefile.js](makefile.js) is shown below:

```bash
$ jsmake -h
